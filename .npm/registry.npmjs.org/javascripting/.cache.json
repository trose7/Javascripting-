JAVASCRIPTING\n\n> Learn JavaScript by adventuring around in the terminal.  \n\n> _Looking for more interactive tutorials like this? Go to [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io)._\n\n## Get help\nHaving issues with javascripting? Get help troubleshooting in the [nodeschool discussions repo](http://github.com/nodeschool/discussions), or on gitter:\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/nodeschool/discussions?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n## Install Node.js\n\nMake sure Node.js is installed on your computer.\n\nInstall it from [nodejs.org/download](http://nodejs.org/download)\n\nOn Windows and using v4 or v5 of Node.js? Make sure you are using at least 5.1.0, which provides a fix for a bug on Windows where you can't choose items in the menu.\n\n### Install `javascripting` with `npm`\n\nOpen your terminal and run this command:\n\n```\nnpm install --global javascripting\n```\n\nThe `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.\n\n#### Having issues with installation?\n\nIf you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:\n\n```\nsudo npm install --global javascripting\n```\n\nYou can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions\n\n## Run the workshop\n\nOpen your terminal and run the following command:\n\n```\njavascripting\n```\n\nYou'll see the menu:\n\n![javascripting screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\nNavigate the menu with the up & down arrow keys. \n\nChoose a challenge by hitting enter.\n\n### Take a look at this gif that shows the first challenge:\n\n![first challenge](javascripting.gif)\n\nIn the gif I'm using the command line editor `nano` ([here are some basic usage tips for nano](https://github.com/sethvincent/dev-envs-book/blob/master/chapters/05-editors.md#nano)).  \n\nYou can use any editor you like. \n\n[atom](http://atom.io) or [brackets](http://brackets.io/) are both good options.\n\n## Need help with an exercise?\n\nOpen an issue in the nodeschool/discussions repo: https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions\n\nInclude the name `javascripting` and the name of the challenge you're working on in the title of the issue.\n\n## TODOS:\n\nAdd these challenges:\n\n- \"OBJECT KEYS\"\n- \"FUNCTION RETURN VALUES\"\n- \"THIS\"\n- \"SCOPE\"\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"julianduque","email":"julianduquej@gmail.com"},{"name":"leichtgewicht","email":"martin.heidegger@gmail.com"},{"name":"sethvincent","email":"sethvincent@gmail.com"},{"name":"someoneweird","email":"adam@boxxen.org"},{"name":"tdd","email":"tdd@tddsworld.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-10-11T21:02:00.578Z","created":"2014-09-29T23:39:48.451Z","1.0.0":"2014-09-29T23:39:48.451Z","1.0.1":"2014-09-29T23:59:19.313Z","1.1.0":"2014-09-30T03:36:31.160Z","1.1.1":"2014-10-06T22:17:28.676Z","1.1.2":"2014-10-08T19:25:17.003Z","1.1.3":"2014-10-13T17:50:45.871Z","1.2.0":"2014-10-20T04:57:18.962Z","1.3.0":"2014-10-23T10:17:02.186Z","1.4.0":"2014-10-27T19:00:20.854Z","1.5.0":"2014-11-01T05:55:21.193Z","1.6.0":"2014-11-03T20:58:04.269Z","1.7.0":"2014-11-12T20:28:22.482Z","1.8.0":"2014-12-01T20:11:39.730Z","1.9.0":"2014-12-18T18:21:37.619Z","1.9.1":"2015-01-05T20:35:57.055Z","1.10.0":"2015-01-17T19:01:03.101Z","1.10.1":"2015-01-19T17:27:29.520Z","1.10.2":"2015-01-28T21:51:37.488Z","1.10.3":"2015-02-01T19:09:58.401Z","1.11.0":"2015-02-20T19:05:53.381Z","1.11.1":"2015-03-16T23:32:20.983Z","1.12.0":"2015-03-30T17:38:33.315Z","2.0.0":"2015-05-18T17:27:51.004Z","2.0.1":"2015-05-18T18:31:43.565Z","2.0.2":"2015-05-23T19:54:00.637Z","2.0.3":"2015-05-25T17:13:25.100Z","2.1.0":"2015-09-04T02:15:34.600Z","2.2.0":"2015-10-23T07:19:07.223Z","2.2.1":"2015-10-23T23:19:39.222Z","2.3.0":"2015-11-21T02:27:00.499Z","2.4.0":"2015-12-14T18:49:37.467Z","2.4.1":"2016-02-11T05:16:03.381Z","2.5.0":"2016-03-15T04:52:07.884Z","2.6.0":"2016-04-16T23:23:00.220Z","2.6.1":"2016-10-11T21:02:00.578Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting#readme","repository":{"url":"git+https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting.git"},"author":{"name":"sethvincent"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"substack":true,"alanshaw":true,"mykhael":true,"pnevares":true,"nickleefly":true,"nicolasmccurdy":true,"tylerm":true,"mattqs":true,"coder_clod":true},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"57fd5348-9f6f\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 21:02:00 GMT"}
